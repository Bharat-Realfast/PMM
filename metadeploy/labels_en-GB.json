Instead, install Program Management Module in one of your free sandbox environments or a developer organization first.\r\n\r\nSalesforce.org Program Management Module (“PMM”) is an extensible application with open source and closed source components to address the unique core needs of program management. PMM utilizes a Salesforce.com, Inc. (“Salesforce”) managed package to provide nonprofits with a path to centralize programmatic information in order to more effectively manage and deliver programs and services. Program Management Module provides out-of-the-box translations for Spanish, French, German, Dutch, and Japanese.\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed Program Management, check out the resources in our documentation:\r\n\r\n* [Program Management Module Documentation](https://powerofus.force.com/s/article/PMM-Documentation)\r\n\r\nQuestions?
