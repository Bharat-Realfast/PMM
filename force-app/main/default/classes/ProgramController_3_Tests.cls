        // It does not have a mock interface provided, hence we will rely on actual data which might be returned from it.
        // Typically, we would use Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() to reset governor limits and test asynchronous code, but they're not required here as no such operations are performed.

        // Assert
        // The actual list of stages returned depends on the implementation details of getActiveStages()
        // and the data present in the environment. Since we cannot predict this data, we will assert that the method returns a non-null list.

        // If there is a known set of active stages that should always be present, we can assert for their presence.

        // System.assert(activeStages.contains('Stage1'), 'Active stages should include "Stage1".');
